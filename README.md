Security management is a set of procedures adapted by an organization to help protect and secure all data and servers belonging to the organization. Security management system project is based on this concept only. It keeps the record of visitors visiting the organization. It contains four panels: Admin, Requester, Approver and Guard/Employee. The requester creates the request of permitting the visitor to come in the organization. The request is further transferred to the approver. If the approver approves the request, then the details of request is forwarded to the guard and the visitor is allowed to come in the organization premises. After verifying the request, a new RFID is issued to the visitor as he/she is first time visiting the organization. Also, all the information about visitorâ€™s gadgets (laptop, any storage device or both) is kept in the record.
